**Tech Stack**
I use this stack for this project:
- React JS -> Frontend web framework. I chose React because React can be scaled up and is easy to maintain. I would pick Next.js, but I think it is overengineering for a landing page.
- Typescript -> Safe type for JavaScript. Still learning, and it is important to make sure the data types are correct.
- Tailwind CSS -> Styling framework. With tailwind, I can style it more easily and still beautiful.
- Vercel -> Web hosting. For deploying the Slerate website for free and just connect it to GitHub to deploy.
- Github -> Version control. I use GitHub to make sure I save all my progress, can share on another device, and collaborate.
- Figma -> Creating design. I usualy make a design before develop the website for make it faster than just go to code.

**Key Takeaways**
1. I learn how to make every element meaningful. Not only aesthetic, but useful too for the user.
2. How to write clean code. My code is not clean enough, but I am  trying to make my code readable and can be read by other people.
3. Collaboration with AI for UX writer. I struggle with UX Writer and the dummy data, so I ask AI to make it.
